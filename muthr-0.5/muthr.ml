(* [readb] is used both for simple [read] and [read_or_take].

   The [go] boolean is there to avoid race conditions in
   [read_or_take].  In the simple read case, it's just a ref to true.

   In [read_or_take], a thread [mvar_wait] is put in the [mv.read] so
   that it is scheduled for execution as soon as a value is put in the
   mvar.  When run, if [go] is not true it sets it, kills the [read]
   thread by cleaning the readers entry and run [ktake] proper. If
   [go] is true, that means that [check_io] has scheduled the [read]
   thread (certainly between the moment we were scheduled and the
   moment we actually run) so we do nothing (but put back the mvar
   value, since we cancel its taking up).

   [check_io] checks [go] as well.  If it is set, the [ktake] has been
   run, we do nothing (clean readers ZZZ). Otherwise we set it, clean
   the [mv.read] entry so to avoid the [ktake] branch been triggered
   later, and proceed.
